# Promotion Strategy

## Building GnoSocial: A Decentralized Microblogging Platform with Gno.land

# Basic Promotion:

It all starts with attention and engagement, both without and outside of the current community:

* Share the blog post on the existing social media channels, whatever they may be.
* Share the blog post on Gno.land's official Discord and Telegram channels.
* If we _really_ want to drive engagement, create a realm that people can use to register their own Gnosocial implementations, and turn it into a contest/hackathon, offering a prize or prizes to the most interesting or innovative who register.

KPI: Number of new GnoSocial deployments tracked via Gno Scan.

It might also be interesting to see how many people engage with my implementation, creating test DMs or posts.

# Interactive Workshop Series:

Live coding and streaming it can be a great way to connect with and build a developer audience. I could live stream hacking sessions where the capabilities of Gnosocial are extended, slowly turning it from a trivial tutorial example into a real, functioning microblogging platform.
 
KPI: This would have to be a part of a larger streaming strategy, but the KPIs would revolve around audience growth and audence engagement as the series progressed. 

#GnoSocial Hackathon Challenge:

This is an expansion of the register-your-best-Gnosocial idea that I presented earlier. 

* Launch a challenge for developers to add new features to GnoSocial (e.g., hashtags, user profiles, image support, support for a User Interface realm, and individual control of one's data, etc...).
* Establish some prize amounts and prize categories, and a starting/ending period for the Hackathon.
* Use a Realm for participants to register their entries and their participation.
* After it's over, and winners have been declared, showcase the best implementations on the Gno.land blog and on social media.

KPI: Number of challenge submissions, and the engagement that the social media around this event drives. How much other attention can it generate, both during and after the event.

# Cross-Platform Content Distribution:

* Create a video version of the tutorial for YouTube. Some people like watching videos a lot more than they like reading blog posts. Likewise, I could live stream working through the tutorial itself, for the same reasons (as part of a larger live streaming content strategy).
* Write a condensed version for dev.to and Hashnode to reach more developers. This basically involves creating a terse version of the tutorial that can be published to these social blogging sites, which would then also link back to the full tutorial.

KPI: Total reach across platforms, click-throughs to the full blog post, increase in the number of Gnosocial realms deployed.


# Target KPIs:

## Deployment Metrics:

100+ new GnoSocial deployments within the first month


## Engagement Metrics:

1000+ total interactions (posts + DMs) on featured GnoSocial instances


## Content Reach:

10,000+ views of the blog post across all platforms
1,000+ click-throughs to the Gno Playground template


## Developer Adoption:

50+ unique developers contributing new features to GnoSocial


These numbers were selected without context, as there are details about the current community and its engagement patterns that I am not currently privy to. So, they are likely wrong, but they serve to illustrate some of the interesting ways that engagement related to Gnosocial could be meastured.
This strategy combines community engagement, interactive learning, content distribution, and gamification to promote the blog post and drive adoption of Gno.land and GnoSocial. The KPIs are designed to measure both the reach of the content and the practical application of the tutorial, leveraging the unique features of Gno.land's ecosystem.
