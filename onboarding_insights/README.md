# Onboarding, My Initial Experience

This is a free form document, based on my own impressions, coming into this task as a developer with considerable lifetime experience with building software, with modest prior experience with Golang, and with no prior experience with Gno.land.

Key metrics for me, when evaluating onboarding, is:

* whether the information is readily available -- did I have to hunt around to even get started?
* whether it is organized in an easy-to-use way -- can I figure out where I need to go to answer specific questions once I am started?
* whether it can deliver a quick positive experience -- are there some easy tutorials that work correctly, and that provide me with answers to all of the basic questions, or at least provide me with some of the answers such that I can readily build on it to find the other foundational information?

## The Good

It was easy to find enough information to get started, to gain some context, and to do things like successfully build a counter Realm.

## The Bad

There are a bunch of tools, and bunch of concepts, and a bunch of fundamental pieces of information that are scattered across a lot of reading, with only subtle or vague connections in between them. I will end up spending far more time on this task than I should if I deep dive into this here, but I *did* spend a lot of time exploring things like gnokey and gnodev, and the CLI interactions with Gno code, trying to figure out how _local_ development would work (versus just using the Playground and the testnet), and I still have far more questions than I do answers. There are also some things, such as how to make a realm upgradeable, that I still haven't discovered. Even relatively simple things like the _purpose and usage_ of the Render function are kind of hidden. It's not easy to use the search function to find this (I tested it), and when it is introduced, there is a single *here* link to take one to another page that does a high level introduction of the concept. Yet, the render function is integral to every realm.

There is a lot of information in the docs, and in isolation, a lot of it is well written, and informative, and pleasant to read, but taken as a whole, the onboarding experience could be a lot smoother. I also feel like there are definitely some simple refinements to things like the Playground that could go a long way towards making the developer experience with that tool a much more positive one.
